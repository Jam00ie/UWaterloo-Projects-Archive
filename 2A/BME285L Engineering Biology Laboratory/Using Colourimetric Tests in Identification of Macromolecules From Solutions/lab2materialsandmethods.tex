\section*{Materials and Methods}
Procedures outlined in the~\textcite[p. 16--24]{LM2023} were followed to complete the experiment. 
Tests were conducted in the order of iodine, Benedict's and Biuret. 
After cleaning and drying the test tubes between Benedict's and Biuret tests, trace amounts of residual water were still present on the inner surface of the tubes.
Due to safety reasons, test tube clamps were omitted from the procedure. Instead, the test tubes were handled with bare hands to provide better grip as the tubes did not reach high enough temperatures to cause harm to the skin.
