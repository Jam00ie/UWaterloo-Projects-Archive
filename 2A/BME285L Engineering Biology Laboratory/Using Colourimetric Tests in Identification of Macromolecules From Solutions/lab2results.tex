\section*{Results}

In the experiment, three solutions/reagents were used; pale yellow, light blue, and no colour was observed for Lugol's iodine, Benedict's reagent, and Biuret reagent respectively.

The sample solutions were all colourless before being tested on except for 5\% honey and 1\% protein solutions which had a subtle yellow tint, and beer which had a orange tint.

In Table~\ref{tab1}, solutiuons that did not react to colourimetric tests were marked with a minus sign, and changes in colour from solutions that tested positve were recorded.

Additional observations were as follows. The solution of 1\% glycogen under Benedict's testing displayed a green hue and a minor presence of an orange precipitate, which, when mixed with the green solution, resulted in a brownish appearance. 1\% protein under iodine testing exhibited a deeper shade of blue in comparison to the other negative results. Beer under iodine testing exhibited a yellow-orange coloration as opposed to the pale yellow color observed in other negative results, and under Biuret testing, it exhibited an olive coloration as opposed to the expected light blue hue observed in other negative results.
